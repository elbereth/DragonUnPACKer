  What is DLNGC ?
  ---------------

This program allow you to make .LNG files for Elbereth's programs using
external language support (ex: Dragon UnPACKer 5). Allowing you if you want to
make a translation to any language of your choice (your language for example).


  How to use DLNGC
  ----------------

The compiler by itself is very easy to use.
Just run it with the filename you wish to compile.

Ex: DLNGC example.ls

But the LSF (Language Source file) format can seem strange.
The only doc you will have is the commented LS file given (english.ls) from
the Dragon UnPACKer archive.
It should be enough to understand how to translate the file.


  Compatibility list
  ------------------

DLNGC v4.0 is compiling DLNG files version 4.
Here is a list of programs supporting this format:

Program Name          ID      Version      (Internal Version)
