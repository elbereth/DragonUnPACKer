The only thing you need is:

 + DLNGC.EXE version 3 file (should be along with this text file in same dir).
 + The translated LSF (for an example see english.ls).

The example files:

 English.LS     English translation
 Espanol.LS     Spanish translation

In order to make your translation, you will have to make a new LS File, you
should copy one of this files to a new file (ex: MyTranslation.LS).

Then you will have to edit file and follow instructions.

When your LS file is finished you only need to compile your LSF to a LNG file
by using DLNGC.EXE.

Ex: DLNGC MyTranslation.LS

When LNG file is created put it in the \Data\ sub directory of Dragon UnPACKer
and run Dragon UnPACKer with the /lng command line.

Ex: DrgUnPACK5.exe /lng

The program will ask you to select your language, select yours and voila!

When your LNG file is working (tested) you can contact Alex Devilliers (the
author of Dragon UnPACKer) so it can distribute the new language from its
homepage.
