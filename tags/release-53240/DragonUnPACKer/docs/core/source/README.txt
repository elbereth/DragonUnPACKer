If you are looking to the end-user Dragon UnPACKer meant to be used directly
you downloaded the wrong file. What you need is the binary release.


Needed:

You need a Delphi compiler. The Borland Delphi Personnal Edition (which is
free) version 6 or 7 will do the job.
You obviously also need some Delphi programming skills. :P

Needed libraries:
- VirtualTreeView v4.5.2        http://www.soft-gems.net/VirtualTreeview/
- Jedi VCL v3.33                http://www.delphi-jedi.org
- ICS Internet Component Suite  http://www.overbyte.be
- Drag&Drop Component Suite 4.0 http://www.users.on.net/johnson/delphi/
- cxCPU v4.x                    http://www.carbonsoft.com/cxcpu/

For Compile Time (in about box) :
- Compile Time Expert v1.12	    http://www.fi.muni.cz/~xkovalc/
