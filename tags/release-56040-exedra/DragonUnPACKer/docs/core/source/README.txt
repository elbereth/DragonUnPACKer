If you are looking to the end-user Dragon UnPACKer meant to be used directly
you downloaded the wrong file. What you need is the binary release.


Needed:
-------

You need a Delphi compiler. The Borland Delphi Personnal Edition (which is
free) version 6 or 7 will do the job (current version is compiled with 
Borland Delphi 7.1 Personal).
You obviously also need some Delphi programming skills. :P

Lazarus/FPC compilation can be tried, some plugins can be compiled for ex.

Needed libraries:
- cxCPU v4.x                    http://www.carbonsoft.com/cxcpu/
- Drag&Drop Component Suite 5.1 http://melander.dk/
- Vampyre Imaging Library v0.26.4 http://imaginglib.sourceforge.net/
- VirtualTreeView v4.8.5        http://www.soft-gems.net/VirtualTreeview/
- Windows 7 Component Library   http://www.gumpi.com/blog
  (This can be avoided by changing TdwProgresBar to TProgressBar in Core
   and HyperRipper and correcting the few lines calling special features
   in those components)
   
For Compile Time (in about box) :
- Compile Time Expert v1.12	    http://www.fi.muni.cz/~xkovalc/

For setup compilation you need Inno Setup v5.3.11 from:
