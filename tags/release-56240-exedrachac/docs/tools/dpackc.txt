===============================================================================

  What is DPACKC ?
  ----------------

This program allow you to make .D5P files (Dragon UnPACKer 5 Package). Those
files allows to install your plugins (for example) automatically into the
user's Dragon UnPACKer 5 install directory.

D5P files are installed using the Duppi file.


  How to use DPACKC
  -----------------

  MENU
  
  The project menu allows to:
    - Start a NEW project (reset everything)
    - OPEN a project: Load a previously saved project file (.D5PP XML files)
      Please note that the file added in that saved project must still be
      available for the project to load successfully!
    - SAVE a project: Save the current project to a project file (.D5PP XML
      file). Quite useful if you want to re-use the stuff for later versions of
      your plugin. ;)
      
      
  ABOUT
  
  Nothing there but the "about the program" information. ;)
  

  HEADER

On the Header tab you can set the information of your package:
- Package name (max 255 characters)
- Package author (max 255 characters)
- Package URL (max 255 characters) include the protocol, this must be a full
  URL (ex: http://www.elberethzone.net)
- Package comment (max 255 characters for v2 and v3 files, 32767 characters for
  v4 files)
No field is mandatory but a package without name will look awful...

You must also indicate the version number of your pack (this is also important)
by indicating a number on the xyzir form:
   x = Major version (between 0 and 10000)
   y = Minor version (0 to 9)
   z = Sub version (0 to 9)
   i = Release type
   				0 = Alpha
   				1 = Beta
   				2 = Release Candidate
   				3 = Gold
   				4/5/6 = Release
   				7 = Fix
   				8 = Patch
   				9 = Special
   r = Release number (0 for no number else 1 to 9)

Ex: 14551 would mean v1.4.5 Release K (or 1.4.5k)

Well use the program to know how it will look like.

You can also enable a check on Dragon UnPACKer version needed to install the
package. This is useful if your plugin do not support older versions of Dragon
UnPACKer. The number to fill there is the build number of Dragon UnPACKer (for
example v5.2.0.169 then you would use 169).

You can also use a custom Duppi banner to display in your package.
Select the option and browse for a Windows BitMaP (.BMP) file in 465x90 size.
The image can be uncompressed RGB or RLE encoded.

  OPTIONS

There is an option to choose between different versions of DUPP file format.
You can read the compatibility section to know which version is compatible with
what.

Short list of compatibility:
Dragon UnPACKer v5.2.0b and olders   --> Use v2
Dragon UnPACKer v5.3.0 to 5.3.3 Beta --> Prefer v3 (v2 not recommended)
For all newer versions               --> Prefer v4 (v2/v3 not recommended)

The others options in that tab only apply to version 4 DUPP format.

  Allowed compression algorithm (at least one must be selected):
    None - Do not compress, faster but big D5P files
    Zlib - Fast compression, fast but weak compression
    LZMA - Best compression, slow but good compression
  (Version 4 will always select the best compression algorithm, ie. the one who
   compress to less bytes, but you can disable some algorithms if you want)
  
  File compression scheme:
    Each file independently - All files will be compressed independently
                              This is the faster and recommended for single
                              files packages. For multiple files the resulting
                              package will be bigger than solid scheme.
    Solid (all files in one block) - This is the best option for multiple files
                                     the resulting package will be smaller.
  
  File hash algorithm:
    Select the hash algorithm you want to use in your package. SHA512 should be
    the best option (but obviously not the faster to compute).


  FILES
  
The files tab is the heart of this tool. There you click on the [+] button to
add files to the project. The tool will automatically detect what it think are
best settings for the file, but you can change most of the settings by
selecting the file in the list and changing them:

  Install into: This dropdown list are the base directories of Dragon UnPACKer
    {program}\data\convert         Where convert plugins are stored
    {program}\data                 Where languages, dulk & uht are stored
    {program}\data\drivers         Where drivers plugins are stored
    {program}\data\hyperripper     Where HyperRipper plugins are stored
    {program}                      The install directory of Dragon UnPACKer
    {program}\utils                Where tools are stored (ex: Duppi)
    {program}\utils\templates      Where templates sources are stored
    {program}\utils\translations   Where translations sources are stored

Note: This field cannot be changed if the file type is a plugin (the correct
      install directory is automatically selected).  
  
  Compress (use best algorithm): Store the file compressed with Zlib\LZMA. If
                                 unchecked the file will be stored without
                                 any compression.
                                 For v2 and v3 files only Zlib will be used.
                                 For v4 files Zlib, LZMA or no compression will
                                 be used depending on the selected algorithm in
                                 the options tab. The smaller of the 3 options
                                 will be used (sometimes LZMA & Zlib produces
                                 larger result than by not compressing at all).

  Do not install if a newer version already exist: Well... Prevents the package
                                                   to install if a newer
                                                   plugin is already installed.

Note: Only available for compatible plugins (if the program could retrieve
      version information).
      Highly recommended to keep it checked!
      
  Store data and time of the file are the attributes of
      the file. If you don't check the date & time will not be stored,
      therefore not restored on the end-user side when installed.
      
  Hidden/Read only: If you need your file to be one and/or the other...

  Register (ActiveX OCX/DLL): Run regsvr32 on the file upon installation.
                              This is useful for ActiveX components for ex.
                              This will only be available for DLL and OCX files

  Delete file (if version lower or equal): This indicates to Duppi that the file
                                           must be deleted from Dragon UnPACKer
										   installation directory because it is
										   obsolete. All files with version
										   lower or equal will be removed.

Note: Selecting this option for at least one entry will force DUPP version 4 and
      will require Duppi v3.2.0+ to install the resulting file.


  UPDATE CREATOR

With this tab you can easily create a differential update between two Dragon
UnPACKer versions. In order for it to work you need the two versions in two
different directories.

Select the old directory and the new one then press the Retrieve different and
new files button. Both directories will be scanned. When a file of same name
and same size is found their SHA-512 hash will be calculated if it is different
it will be added to the list. All new files and files with different size will
be automatically added.  
  

  COMPILE
  
This is the final step, choosing a filename and then compile the package.
Then you can test it with Duppi. :)

The compile log can help you to know if something went wrong.


  Compatibility list
  ------------------

DPACKC v3.6.1 is compiling:
  DUPP files version 2 (Duppi v2.0.2+)
  DUPP files version 3 (Duppi v2.2.0+)
  DUPP files version 4 (Duppi v3.0.0+)
  DUPP files version 4 with delete files features (Duppi v3.2.0+)

Those files can be installed by all versions of Duppi since v2.0.2 (that means
since Dragon UnPACKer v5.0.0 RC3!

DUPP v2 is compatible with all versions of Duppi (for Dragon UnPACKer stables)
but suffer from a CRC calculation mistake on included files.

DUPP v3 is compatible with all versions of Duppi since v2.2.0 and do not suffer
from the CRC mistake. The only difference between the two formats is the CRC
calculation. The formats in itself are structuraly identical.

DUPP v4 is compatible with all versions of Duppi since v3.0.0 and is a
completely new format (structure is different than any previous version, only
the header is the same). This fixes a lot of structural mistakes made in
previous versions, introduce a lot of sanity checks (secure hashs instead of
CRC32, etc..) and uses LZMA compression algorithm which leads to much smaller
packages files. This format can therefore be used as an full update means. For
example to go from one full version of Dragon UnPACKer to another without the
need to download the full file again.

  What's new?
  -----------

Version 3.6.1:

 ! Fixed bug when non-compressed and compressed block had same size. It would
   refuse compilation with "No compression found" error.
   Now it will default to no compression.
   
  
Version 3.6.0:

 + Added feature to DUPP v4 to delete obsolete files in Dragon UnPACKer
   installation directory.

  
Version 3.5.2 (unreleased):

 + Added expert option to override the needed version of Duppi of DUPPv4 files.
   This option is NOT saved in .D5PP project file.


Version 3.5.1:

 - Removed almost all JVLC components used.
   Only SimpleXML is still used for project files (D5PP).
 i This had the effect to reduce EXE file by ~137KiB.
 + Added some sanity checks to avoid weird errors.
 
 
Version 3.5.0:

 + Added Update Creator tool.
 * Improved the tab order.
 

Version 3.0.0:

 * Project files (.D5PP) version 3 to store new info needed by DUPP v4 format.
 ! Fixed bug where when loading a project file failed, the next time the open
   button was pressed nothing happened.
 * The add file button now allow multi-select.
 + Enabled the use of custom Duppi pictures.
 + Added full support for DUPP version 4 file format:
     Block based structure, very flexible and robust.
     Compression algorithms: Zlib & LZMA
     Solid compression
     Secure hashs: SHA256 for blocks
                   MD4,SHA1,SHA256,SHA512 & RIPEMD160 for files
     Sanity checks: Ensure the file has no errors  


Version 2.0.0:

 i Too much to say. The program now works as it should, and I think I have
   found and fixed most bugs.
 + New Project files (.D5PP) to store new info.
   The format is just version 2 of the old format (.DPS) adding new XML nodes.
 ! I found a huge mistake in the CRC calculation done on files while compiling.
   The problem is by fixing it the D5P file is not working correctly with
   current version of Duppi because the mistake is there too...
   This means I had to add an option to be compatible with old buggy Duppi.
   The new correct implementation will produce D5P files that can only be used
   with Duppi v2.2.0 or earlier.
  

Version 1.0.0 Beta 1:

 + Added Load/Save project to .DPS (XML file / D5P Project).
 - Disabled custom banner (Duppi is unable to display them for the moment).
   This feature still needs to be worked out.
 i Program doesn't remember anything (recent save/load, window position, etc.).
