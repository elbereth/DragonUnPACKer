  What is DUHTComp ?
  ------------------

This program allow you to make .UHT files for Dragon UnPACKer 5.
Allowing you if you want to make a HTML Template for the HTML List feature of
Dragon UnPACKer.


  How to use DUHTComp
  -------------------

The compiler by itself is very easy to use.
Just run it with the filename you wish to compile.

Ex: DUHTComp example.ts

But the TSF (Template Source file) format can seem strange.
The only doc you will have is the commented TS files given in the examples
(ex-*.zip files).

You can find those examples in the files:
  ex-homepage.zip       Dragon UnPACKer 4 HTML Style v1.1c
  ex-text.zip           Text Database v1.0b
  ex-xml.zip            XML Database v1.0b

It should be enough to understand how to make a template.

The resulting .UHT file must be placed in the \data\ subfolder of Dragon
UnPACKer 5.

But here is the list of macros to know:
(H = Header, F = Footer and V = Variable)

                   HFV
  $$FILE$$           X File (ex: VERSION.TXT)
  $$FILE0$$          X File without extension (ex: VERSION)
  $$FILEEXT$$        X File extension (ex: TXT)
  $$FILENAME$$     XXX Filename of the currently opened file in Dragon UnPACKer
  $$FORMAT$$       XX  Format of the currently opened file in Dragon UnPACKer
  $$DESC$$           X Description
  $$DIRECTORY$$    XXX Current directory in main file
  $$DUPVER$$       XX  Dragon UnPACKer version (displayed #.##.##)
  $$DUPEDIT$$      XX  Dragon UnPACKer release (displayed ###, ex: Beta)
  $$DUPURL$$       XX  Dragon UnPACKer Web page URL
  $$LNG<??????>$$  XX  Dragon UnPACKer Language keyword "??????"
  $$OFFSET$$         X Offset
  $$FOFFSET$$        X Offset (formatted with thousands seps)
  $$HOFFSET$$        X Offset (In Hexa, ex: 0009AD01)
  $$SIZE$$           X Size
  $$FSIZE$$          X Size (formatted with thousands seps)
  $$HSIZE$$          X Size (In Hexa, ex: 0009AD01)
  $$TOTNUMBYTES$$  XX  Number of bytes in file
  $$TOTNUMFILES$$  XX  Number of files in file
  $$FTOTNUMBYTES$$ XX  Number of bytes in file (formatted with thousands seps)
  $$FTOTNUMFILES$$ XX  Number of files in file (formatted with thousands seps)
  
The formatted macros (with thousands separators) will use your Windows settings
to format the number (ex: USA thousands separator is "," but in France it is
" ").
