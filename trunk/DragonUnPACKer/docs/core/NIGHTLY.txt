Dragon UnPACKer Nightly Binary                                  MPL open source
by Alexande "Elbereth" Devilliers
===============================================================================

This nightly binary comes with no guarantee. It is automatically compiled
every night when a change in the SVN repository was commited since last
compilation. It might (will) not work.

In any case, only binary/compiled files are provided in the archive. The
process of compilation is a SVN checkout of HEAD from module DragonUnPACKer
then the source is compiled using DCC32.EXE from Delphi 7 Personnal.

All files should be extracted in an existing installation of the last working
Dragon UnPACKer (stable or unstable whichever is newer) preserving directories
in the archive.
