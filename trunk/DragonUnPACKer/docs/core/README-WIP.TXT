Main program version and versions history:

Version 5.6.1.245
Release [Unreleased]

 i Now using FastMM v4.97 as memory manager. Only core for the moment.
 ! Fixed a lot of memory leaks (more to come). Thanks to FastMM debuging mode.
 ! Fixed the missing sort options in the file listing pane. Clicking on the
   header would do nothing.
 * Elbereth's Main Driver plugin v2.1.1:
   * Enhanced Bloodrayne .POD support by using buffered directory reading.
   + Added Ghostbusters: The Video Game .POD support (POD5).
     This is almost the same file format as Bloodrayne .POD (POD3).
