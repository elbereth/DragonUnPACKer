Main program version and versions history:

Version 5.2.0.167
Release [23/12/2005]

 i Since last version 5.1.2 WIP (9 months ago), I was quite inactive in
   developping  Dragon UnPACKer. But the last few days were quite productive
   (imho). Here is the result: A new version for 2005 (just in time).
 + Ability to use priority for Drivers plugins.
   What is that for ?
   Well, basically for expert users this allows to prefer one driver over
   another one when trying to open files.
   For example:
   If you want drv_mix to try opening a file before drv_default you will give
   drv_mix a priority higher than for drv_default.
   Maximum priority: 200
   Minimum priority:   0
 + New error dialog box. I hope this will allow for better bug reports.
   (Not used everywhere, but should show in most situations)
 + Add a log to the UI to know what is going on.
   You can hide this new log thingy (hint: right click or in the options).
 + Added a new log options tab (in the Options obviously)
 + New convert and driver plugin system (respectively DUCI v3 and DUDI v4).
   This allow for direct (without using temporary file, therefore faster)
   convertion. This was created with preview feature in mind.
 * Enhanced HyperRipper and plugin to support very big files (more than 2GB).
 * UT Packages driver plugin is now v2.3.0 (DUDI v4):
   * Now using TUTPackages v2.3-cvs (09/05/2004)
     This is certainly the last version ever from Antonio Cordero.
     Modified it a bit to support extraction to a stream.     
   + Added Game Hint structure. This is needed for better game support by the
     library. For every new file you open it will popup asking from which game
     is the file. Just select the game in the drop down list.
     If the game is not in the list, it will most probably be not supported
     correctly.
 * ZIP driver plugin is now v1.1.0 (DUDI v4):
   i Now using UnZip.pas from Gerke Preussner <j3rky@gerke-preussner.de>
     InfoZIP UnZip for Delphi Wrapper (http://www.gerke-preussner.de)
   * Now using UnZip32.Dll (InfoZip) v5.5.2.
   i This version of the plugin is extracting the whole entry to memory and
     then writes it into a file. If needed I might add an option to go direct
     to disk when file is more than a certain size.
 ! Fixed bug #1118661: Very Big Files failure
 ! Fixed bug #1066079: Caption "Drivers" cannot be translated
 * Convert plugin is now v2.0.1 (DUCI v3):
   + New convert function that use TStream input and output.
   * Old convert function are now only wrappers to the new functions.
   ! Fixed some bugs (not sure they weren't introduced by the TStream system)
 * Main driver plugin is now v2.0.0 (DUDI v4):
   + New extraction function that use TStream as output.
   + Added progress display for a bunch of extraction functions.
   + Added support for Age of Empires 3 .BAR files
   + Added support for Black & White 2 .STUFF & .LUG files
   + Added support for Civilization 4 .FPK files
   + Added support for Fable: The Lost Chapters .LUG files
   + Added support for F.E.A.R. .ARCH00 files
   + Added support for LEGO Star Wars .DAT files
   + Added support for The Lord of the Rings: Battle for Middle Earth .BIG files
   + Added support for The Movies .BIG & .LUG files
 * Duppi v2.1.0:
   + Now using the new Dragon UnPACKer Update Server [DUS] version 3 (PHP based,
     sources included).
     That means Duppi will only display updates & translations related to your
     version of Dragon UnPACKer.
   + Now also support internet retrieval of translations directly from Duppi!
   + Added support to retrieve version number for all 3 new plugins interfaces
     (DUCI v3, DUDI v4 and DUHI v3)
   ! Fixed bug #1066080: Caption: "InfoLab" while connecting to server
   i Compiled for support of language files version 9.
 

Version 5.0.0.134
Release [18/07/2004]

 i I think it is time for a stable release. In the last 2 months I only had 6
   bug fix request (I fixed 3, 2 couldn't be fixed with current structure of
   the program and 1 wasn't reproductible for me).
   Before stable release I had hoped to have a full help file and manual.
   David_s_tr is working on them. But I have some plans that will require deep
   changes in the core of Dragon UnPACKer, for this I will make the 5.1 branch
   on CVS after release of 5.0.
 ! Fixed bug #958620 : Translation problem when starting with unknown file
   format.
 ! Fixed bug #958622 : Problem in create entry list dialog (combobox only show
   "v").
 * Main Driver v1.3.4 Release A:
   i Formely known as "Elbereth's Main Driver".
   + Added Painkiller PAK support. [Partially based on MrMouse information]
   + Added Hitman: Contracts .TEX support.
   + Added Hitman: Contracts .PRM support.
     There are no filenames stored in those files, so the plugin just creates
     ones. Don't rely on those filenames.
   + Added Cyberbykes .BIN support [Request #968745].
 * Picture/Textures Convert v1.0.7:
   ! Fixed some bugs in palette creator (author/name).
   + Added Glacier Engine games (Hitman 2: Silent Assassin, Hitman: Contracts,
     Freedom Fighters, etc..) support for all 4 textures formats :
      - DXT1 to DDS (DXT1 compressed)
      - DXT3 to DDS (DXT3 compressed)
      - PALN to TGA 32bpp w/alpha channel
      - RGBA to TGA 32bpp w/alpha channel
 * Duppi v2.0.3:
   * Changed URL where update data is retrieved (should be faster than the
     older one). Old versions of Duppi will still work (old URL still works).
   ! Fixed bug #958619 : Translation problem in proxy dialog box.


Version 5.0.0.129
Release Candidate 4 [08/05/2004]

 i Biggest change is that Dragon UnPACKer is now open source under the Mozilla
   Public Licence 1.1.
   You can find source on Sourceforge. If you are willing to help developing
   Dragon UnPACKer you are welcome (you need Delphi knowledge). Because I am
   lacking time to work on Dragon UnPACKer don't expect frequent versions if
   I am still alone programming it.
 + New language file format (DLNG v4).
   I hope this will fix problems some translations were having.
 * Elbereth's Main Driver v1.3.1 RC:
   + Added Pixel Painters games normal and extended ressource files support.
     That means following games files are supported:
       Dig It! .XRS files (maybe embedded files are encrypted/decrypted..)
       Electranoid .RES files
       Fuzzy's World of Miniature Space Golf .RES files
       Laser Light .RES files
       Xatax .RES files
     Thanks to "Borg No. One" for his help.
   + Added Command & Conquer: Generals .BIG files support.
   + Experimental Commandos 3 .PCK files support.
     Let me explain: Files are encrypted (light encryption) but I was unable to
     know how to automatically find the decryption key. So if my key "guess"
     code doesn't work the extracted file will be crypted.
     This should never happen to WAV files (should always decrypt).
   + Added Empires: Dawn of the Modern World .SSA support.
     But no decompression (PK01).
   + Added Eve Online STUFF support. [Thanks to DaReverse for infos]
   + Added Spellforce PAK support. [Thanks to DaReverse for infos]
   ! Fixed some weird coding.. :P
   + Added Nocturne POD support. [Requested by Voodoo]
   ! Fixed POD support (when Smart opening is disabled in Dragon UnPACKer).
 ! Fixed two bugs found by Voodoo in the HyperRipper.
 
 
Version 5.0.0.127
Release Candidate 3 [26/09/2003]

 i This is the first version released after testing from the beta testers team.
   Therefore this version should be very stable.
 ! Fixed a bug with icons not read from registry of Windows (if option is
   selected) but from the LOOK file for results of a search.
 ! Fixed cosmetic bugs in the options window.
 * Changed About box. Now all beta testers nicknames appears. There is also
   a list of translators of Dragon UnPACKer.
 * Optimized A LOT the directory browsing. Now for directories with thousands
   of files it is INSTANTANEOUS.
   Achieved using VirtualTree in a better way and in a less important
   proportion using directory cache structure:
     v5.0.0 RC2 method             5000ms
     Without directory caching       50ms
     With directory caching           0ms
 ! Fixed two cosmetic bug in the options menu (File Type and Look weren't
   leading to the right option panel).
 ! Fixed a bug in the option form that was causing an "Access Violation" error
   when no plugin was found of either Driver, Convert and HyperRipper type.
 ! Fixed two missing errors messages for HyperRipper plugins.
 ! Fixed a bug in the option form where the HyperRipper list was using the
   currently selected convert plugin (instead of currently selected HyperRipper
   plugin).
 i Updated all 3 "create list" templates to reflect the new Email and URL.
 * Implemented DUHI (Dragon UnPACKer HyperRipper plugin Interface) v2.
   This allows forms created by the plugin to be considered part of the main
   application. This version is compatible with DUHI v1 and v2.
 * Implemented DUCI (Dragon UnPACKer Convert plugin Interface) v2.
   This allows forms created by the plugin to be considered part of the main
   application. This version is compatible with DUCI v1 and v2.
 * Implemented DUDI (Dragon UnPACKer Driver plugin Interface) v3.
   This allows forms created by the plugin to be considered part of the main
   application. This version is compatible with DUHI v1, v2 and v3.
 * Elbereth's Main Driver v1.2.8 RC:
   + Added support for Battlefield 1942 .RFA files from retail version (not
     only demo). Translated C decompression code from RAT v0.5.0, Refractor2
     Archive Tool to Delphi Pascal. Original C code by:
       Tonto Rostenfaunt <tonto@linuxmail.org>
       Blackjap McGee    <blackjap@hawaii.rr.com>
     RAT can be found at: http://r2at.sourceforge.net/
     RFA parsing was entirely coded from scratch.
     I can send the translated decompression code (Delphi Pascal) if someone
     wants it.
   + Added support for GTA: Vice City .ADF files.
     ADF files are only MP3 files encrypted so opening an ADF file will only
     show one file inside.
 + Elbereth's Picture/Textures Convert v1.0.4 Beta:
   i Now using DUCI v2.
   ! Fixed convert form that wasn't considered a child of main Dragon UnPACKer
     application. (Alt+TAB now works fine)
   + Added Config box allowing to manage palettes.
 i Elbereth's Main HyperRipper plugin v5.0.1 Release C:
   i Now using DUHI v2.
   ! Fixed MPEG Audio config form that wasn't considered a child of main Dragon
     UnPACKer application. (Alt+TAB now works fine)


Version 5.0.0.119
Release Candidate 2 [08/09/2003]

 i As you have probably noticed I got rid of "Dragon Software" name and URL. As
   a result I changed all URLs in core and Duppi to:
   http://www.dragonunpacker.com or http://www.elberethzone.net
 ! Fixed two small cosmetic bugs as reported by Andrew Bondar. :)
   For information:
     "Aucun" displayed at bottom right on startup.
     PnlComment displayed in driver infos.
 ! Fixed a bug in the core application when unknown exceptions is raised by a
   plugin (now it displays the message instead of "%e"). :)
 * Added directory parsing indicator in the percentage bar.
   That way you know that Dragon UnPACKer is working and not crashed.
 + Added support for new drivers plugins generation (using DUDI v2).
   If you are a plugin developer this fixed some big lacks in DUDI v1.
   The following plugins are in developement and will use DUDI v2:
   drv_multiex               MultiEx.dll Wrapper
   drv_11th (final version)  11th Hour & 7th Guest file format support
 ! Fixed a bug where the root of a file was parsed twice the first time.
 - Disabled the security about needed drv_default.d5d file.
   That means this version can run without the drv_default.d5d driver. This is
   if you want to make a special version with only the plugins you want.
 ! Fixed some really minor cosmetic glitches (b instead of B in the HyperRipper
   speed/memory measurement).
 * Optimized some data handling (use pointers instead of copying values where
   possible).
 * Now the directories in the index tree view are sorted.
 ! Fixed extraction status panel position.
 * Elbereth's Main Driver v1.2.7 RC:
   + Added Star Crusader PAK and GL support.
     (I don't know the format of images in the GL files... I only checked it
      was not PCX images. If you know the format please send me a mail so I can
      add the right extension)
   ! Fixed Monkey Island 3 .BUN support.
   + Added Tron 2.0 .REZ to the list of supported games.
 * Duppi v2.0.2:
   * Enhanced so it can show Convert and HyperRipper plugins version info.
   * Implemented some features of the D5P file format into Duppi.
     + Added support for the "new" D5P version 2.
     + Detect the needed Duppi version information from D5P files.
     + Apply D5P needed Dragon UnPACKer 5 version.
     + Custom banner from D5P files is now displayed (if available).
   ! Fixed a small (but important) bug in Duppi. It was impossible to install
     files in sub directories of selected base directory.
     The D5P maker (to be released) don't use this option yet, so all D5P files
     works fine with any version of Duppi.
   + Added support for HyperRipper plugins.
 + Elbereth's Picture/Textures Convert v1.0.3 Beta released:
   + Added support for Bloodrayne .TEX textures.
     Convert to BMP (8bpp) and TGA (8bpp and 24bpp).
     Used information about TEX texture files from Bloodrayne.co.uk forums.
 i Elbereth's Main HyperRipper plugin v5.0.1 Release B:
   + Added much requested Ogg Stream support (Ogg Vorbis for ex).


Version 5.0.0.109
Release Candidate 1 [29-06-2003]

 ! Fixed main menu colors changing.
   (Switched to TJvMainMenu from JEDI Project.)
 * Updated VirtualTreeView to v3.8.3.
 ! Fixed a bug in core application.
   Access violation when double right clicking in the right pane view.
 ! Fixed a small color bug in the right pane popup menu.
 ! Fixed an untranslated error message (when could not open the file).
   Was always in french.
 ! Fixed a bug when extracting all subdirectories the files where
   extracted in the DUP5 directory.
 * Changed the Directory select (when extracting multiple files) dialog.
   Now you can create directories.
 ! Fixed a small color bug in the left pane popup menu.
 * Now DUP5 verifies the file it tries to open really exist before
   trying to open the files using the driver plugins.
 * Updated HyperRipper to version 5.0a:
   * Changed buffer default sizes from too big values (32KB, 64KB and 128KB) to
     much smaller values (256B,512B and 1KB). Using 256B makes HyperRipper much
     much faster to search files than using 32KB buffer.
     Note: If you already used HyperRipper v5.0 you will have to manually
           select the new buffer value in the options.
   + Added new naming scheme for found entries, just check the advanced
     options.
 * Changed left pane view component from TTreeView by TVirtualTreeView.
   The only visible change is the ghosted icon for selected directory.
   Should be faster when adding tons of new directories. But honestly I don't
   see any difference on my computer. :-)
   Anyway this change will allow future visual improvements if needed and
   should take less memory and cpu cycles.
 + Added all missing configuration and about box calling routines in Dragon
   UnPACKer core.
   (Also added About box for every plugin in this release)
 * Elbereth's Main Driver v1.2.5 RC (aka Default Driver):
   + Added Rage of Mages & Rage of Mages 2 RES support.
 * Elbereth's HyperRipper 5 Default plugin (v5.0.0 Release B):
   ! Small glitch fixed ("ave" instead of "Wave").
 * Elbereth's Picture/Textures Convert plugin (v1.0.2 Beta):
   + Added palette creation support.
     Click on the Add button next to the Palette list (on the palette select
     screen). Then open the file with the palette (can be 8Bpp BMP or PCX or
     Microsoft Palette, Jasc PSP Palette or raw palettes).


Version 5.0.0.95
Beta 4 [26-04-2003]

 ! Beta 3 wasn't working under Windows 98. Fixed.
 - Completly removed XP menus. Some reasons:
   1) They were preventing multi-bytes languages to display correctly in menus.
      (ex: Russian, Japanese, Persian, etc..)
   2) The option to disable XP menus wasn't working at all.
   3) Standard menu aspect looks much better :)
 * Cleaned code, now exe is 500KB smaller.
 ! Fixed images from splash and about screen.
 * Default Driver v1.2.3 Beta:
   + Added Port Royale .CPR files support.
   + Added Harbinger .SQH files support.
     This format have tons of directories (at least 5000)... Dragon UnPACKer 5
     is really slow at parsing it.
   + Added Purge .REZ files to the list of supported games.
   + Added Patrician II .CPR files to the supported games. (Thanks to Felix
     Riemann)
 * UT Package Driver v2.1.0:
   + Added Unreal 2 support.
   i Splinter Cell should work (untested).


Version 5.0.0.86

 ! Fixed some user interface glitches under WinXP. (In the option dialog box)
 * Updated VirtualTreeView from 3.6.2 to 3.7.4.
 * Changed a bit the About dialog box of Dragon UnPACKer to show when it was
   compiled (date & time).
 * Added create list with all options:
   List all files, only current dir (with or without sub-directories) & only
   selected entries.
   Sorting of files (by name, offset or size).
   Included templates:
     Dragon UnPACKer 4 HTML Style v1.1b
     Text Database v1.0
     XML Database v1.0
 * Now icons used for embedded files are directly found using your Windows
   registry. That means you will have same icons in DUP5 than in your windows
   explorer. :o)
   I have also added an option to disable this behaviour and use the old
   internal icons.
 * New Exception handler window, but it isn't used...
 * Duppi v2.0.0:
   + Internet update:
     Check for new or updated plugins using Internet. Duppi will then download
     and install them (all downloaded packages are put in your Download sub
     directory of Dragon UnPACKer 5).
   + Now when you run Duppi as is you will be given the choice of check
     Internet for updated packages or browse to a package to install it.
 * HyperRipper Default plugin (v5.0.0 Release A).
   ! Setup button was enabled for S3M and IT file formats (it should not).

   + Added No One Lives for Ever 2 to the list of supported games.
   + Added support for Postal .SAK files.
     Tested only on Postal Plus Demo.
   ! Fixed Jagged Alliance 2 SLF support.
   ! Fixed extraction of non-compressed data in Emperor: Battle for Dune
     RFH/RFD files (resulting in 0 bytes extracted files).
     [Reported by Andrei Zharnasek]
   * Now using same extraction method as in DUP5 core. Allowing display of the
     extraction progress.
 * UT Package driver plugin (v2.0.0 Rel.A):
   i Use TUTPackage v2.0 by Antonio Cordero Balcazar with official UT2003
     support and (partial?) Army Operation.
   * Much better UT2003 support :)
   i Changed the version numbering to reflect TUTPackage version (major and
     minor version number of plugin are now same version as TUTPackage one).
     That means that if major and minor version don't change only minor things
     are changed in the driver. Removed Beta status of driver.
   ! Fixed an enormous bug. There was a debug option that tried to extract raw
     data from Sound entries to H:\ drive. If you didn't have this disk you
     would get an error while extracting Sound files from UAX. Sorry..
   i Please note that Unreal 2 is NOT supported yet!
 * ZIP Driver plugin (v1.0.2):

 + Added HyperRipper v5.0!
   i Same supported file formats as in DUP4.
   i More reliable and efficient than HyperRipper v4.2 (DUP4)!
   i Some tweaking options for those of you that want "complete" control. :)
   i Writing support for the newly HyperRipper File (HRF) version 3.0 file
     format but also for the olders version 1 and 2 (version 0 is unsupported).
   i To bring the configuration panel of MPEG Audio just click on MPEG Audio in
     Format Select tabs and then on Setup buton.
 + Added drag and drop extraction without convertion from Dragon UnPACKer 5 to
   the explorer, desktop, etc..
 + Now the program will run "shell open" on the selected file by
   double-clicking on it.
 * Should be Windows XP friendly (themed).
 * Ah! Finally got XP like menus (like in Office XP).
   For those of you that prefer classic menus go to Icons/Look options tab and
   uncheck the XP Style Menus option.
 + BarfHappy made superb icons for the menus, popups and toolbars.
 ! Fixed "EAccessViolation" when right clicking on a file without extension in
   Dragon UnPACKer 5 listview. (bug found by Felix Riemann)
 ! Fixed the bug reported when multiple drivers wanted to open the same file
   format. (reported by Felix Riemann)

     Tested only on the Demo if someone can test it on the game and give me
     feedback..
   + Added F22 Lightning 3 .PFF in the list of supported games.
   ! Fixed bug where Earth Siege 2 and Tribes .VOL files were not displayed as
     supported (but all code to support them was in the driver).
   ! Fixed support of Novalogic's PFF3 files (.PFF) when using the "Smart file
     format detection" option.. Until I release this version you may disable
     this option when opening PFF3 files.
 * UT Packages Drivers v1.0.4 Beta:
   + Sound extraction from UT2003 and Undying should work now.
   + Added Undying to the list of supported games.
