  What is DLNGC ?
  ---------------

This program allow you to make .LNG files for Elbereth's programs using
external language support (ex: Dragon UnPACKer 5). Allowing you if you want to
make a translation to any language of your choice (your language for example).


  How to use DLNGC
  ----------------

The compiler by itself is very easy to use.
Just run it with the filename you wish to compile.

Ex: DLNGC example.ls

But the LSF (Language Source file) format can seem strange.
The only doc you will have is the commented LS file given (english.ls) from
the Dragon UnPACKer archive.
It should be enough to understand how to translate the file.


  Compatibility list

  What's new?
  -----------

Version 4.1.1:

 + Added /in /include option. This will create:
   <outname>.<ID>.inc file instead of a DLNG v4 file.
   This is for Dragon UnPACKer 5.4.0+ compilation. So unless you want to
   compile it, this new option is useless for you. ;)
   This was needed over the /il option in order to support standalone Duppi. 
 * Improved /il even if not used anymore (the unneeded res: string declaration
   was removed).
   
Version 4.1.0:

 i Removed beta status (worked fine for 5 years now..).
   Still need to add comment to the code...
 + Added /il /internal option. This will create:
   lib_language_internal.pas file instead of a DLNG v4 file.
   This is for Dragon UnPACKer 5 compilation. So unless you want to compile it
   this new option is useless for you. :p
   I added it so I can have a common editing format for all languages: internal
   or not.

Version 4.0.0 Beta:

 i Full support for the new DLNG v4.
   Now uses WideStrings to store the strings (native Unicode support).
   Added compression ability (Zlib).
   Now using again a DLNG v2-like structure.
 i Removed support for DLNG v3 (use DLNGc v3.0.4 for DLNG v3 support).
