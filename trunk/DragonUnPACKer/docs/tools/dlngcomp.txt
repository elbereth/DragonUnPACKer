  What is DLNGCOMP ?
  ------------------

This program allow you to compare two .LNG files and write the report in a text
file. That way you know what are changes between two languages versions or if
you are translating you can check for errors by comparing your language file
and the official one.


  How to use DLNGCOMP
  -------------------

The compare program is really easy to use.
Just run it with the filenames you wish to compare.

Ex: DLNGCOMP english.lng mytranslation.lng
    This will compare english.lng and mytranslation.lng and create a report.txt
Ex: DLNGCOMP mytranslation.lng english.lng diff.txt
    Same as before but will create the file diff.txt instead of report.txt


  Compatibility list
  ------------------

DLNGCOMP v4.0 can compare DLNG files: version 1, 3 and 4 ONLY.
Here is a list of programs supporting those format:

Program Name          ID      Version  DLNG
Dragon UnPACKer       UP      4        v1/v2
Dragon UnPACKer       UP      5.x      v3/v4

DLNGCOMP v4.0 cannot load DLNG files version 2 and thus cannot compare them.
When crypted DLNG version 1 files are loaded some compare features are switched
off because DLNGCOMP v4.0 does not include the needed decrypt code.
If needed just use previous DLNGCOMP versions (v2.0.0 have full version 1
and 2 support).

  What's new?
  -----------

Version 4.0.1:

 * Cleaned up useless code & changed a bit the name, removed copyright...

Version 4.0.0:

 + Added DLNG v4 support (used by Dragon UnPACKer v5.0.0 RC4 and upward).
 i Size increased a lot because of the compression used by DLNG v4...

Version 3.0.2:

 ! Fixed a bug with value comparison that wasn't done.
  
Version 3.0.1:

 i Apparently I succeeded in adding old formats support to DLNGCOMP v3.0.
 + Added partial DLNG v1 support.
   Missing decrypt code (will never be added to DLNGCOMP v3.0).
 + Added RLE Decode code for future use (DLNG v2).

Version 3.0.0:

 i Rewrited from scratch as a native win32 console program.
   Main result is a really small size.. only 48k completly stand alone (no need
   for the huge dlls needed before).
   The drawback is that older formats (version 1 & 2 of LNG files) cannot be
   supported anymore.
 i Support for the new DLNG v3.
