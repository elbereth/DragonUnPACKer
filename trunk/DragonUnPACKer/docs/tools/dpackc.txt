  What is DPACKC ?
  ----------------

This program allow you to make .D5P files (Dragon UnPACKer 5 Package). Those
files allows to install your plugins (for example) automatically into the
user's Dragon UnPACKer 5 install directory.

D5P files are installed using the Duppi file.


  How to use DPACKC
  -----------------

  MENU
  
  The project menu allows to:
    - Start a NEW project (reset everything)
    - OPEN a project: Load a previously saved project file (.D5PP XML files)
      Please note that the file added in that saved project must still be
      available for the project to load successfully!
    - SAVE a project: Save the current project to a project file (.D5PP XML
      file). Quite useful if you want to re-use the stuff for later versions of
      your plugin. ;)
      
      
  ABOUT
  
  Nothing there but the about the program information. ;)
  

  HEADER

On the Header tab you can set the information of your package:
- Package name (max 255 characters)
- Package author (max 255 characters)
- Package URL (max 255 characters) include the protocol, this must be a full
  URL (ex: http://www.elberethzone.net)
- Package comment (max 255 characters)
No field is mandatory but a package without name will look awful...

You must also indicate the version number of your pack (this is also important)
by indicating a number on the xyzir form:
   x = Major version (between 0 and 10000)
   y = Minor version (0 to 9)
   z = Sub version (0 to 9)
   i = Release type
   				0 = Alpha
   				1 = Beta
   				2 = Release Candidate
   				3 = Gold
   				4/5/6 = Release
   				7 = Fix
   				8 = Patch
   				9 = Special
   r = Release number (0 for no number else 1 to 9)

Ex: 14551 would mean v1.4.5 Release K (or 1.4.5k)

Well use the program to know how it will look like.

You can also enable a check on Dragon UnPACKer version needed to install the
package. This is useful if your plugin do not support older versions of Dragon
UnPACKer. The number to fill there is the build number of Dragon UnPACKer (for
example v5.2.0.169 then you would use 169).


  FILES
  
The files tab is the heart of this tool. There you click on the [+] button to
add files to the project. The tool will automatically detect what it think are
best settings for the file, but you can change most of the settings by
selecting the file in the list and changing them:

  Install into: This dropdown list are the base directories of Dragon UnPACKer
    {convert}     \Data\Convert subdirectory (where convert plugins are stored)
    {data}        \Data subdirectory
    {drivers}     \Data\Drivers subdirectory (where drivers plugins are stored)
    {hyperripper} \Data\HyperRipper subdirectory (hyperripper plugins)
    {program}     \ (the install directory of Dragon UnPACKer)

Note: This field cannot be changed if the file type is a plugin (the correct
      install directory is automatically selected).  
  
  Sub-directory: If you need to install the file in a subdirectory...
  
  Compress with Zlib (recommended): Store the file compressed with Zlib. If
                                    unchecked the file will be stored without
                                    any compression.

  Do not install if a newer version already exist: Well... Prevents the package
                                                   to install if a newer
                                                   plugin is already installed.

Note: Only available for compatible plugins (if the program could retrieve
      version information).
      Highly recommended to keep it checked!
      
  Store data and time of the file are the attributes of
      the file. If you don't check the date & time will not be stored,
      therefore not restored on the end-user side when installed.
      
  Hidden/Read only: If you need your file to be one and/or the other...

  Register (ActiveX OCX/DLL): Run regsvr32 on the file upon installation.
                              This is useful for ActiveX components for ex.
                              This will only be available for DLL and OCX files


  COMPILE
  
This is the final step, choosing a filename and then compile the package.
Then you can test it with Duppi. :)

The compile log can help you to know if something went wrong.

There is an option to choose between DUPP v2 and v3. Read next chapter to know
more about that. But in short: To be compatible with Dragon UnPACKer v5.2.0b
and olders --> Use v2. For all new versions prefer v3.


  Compatibility list
  ------------------

DPACKC v2.0.0 is compiling DUPP files version 2 (Duppi v2.0.2+) and version 3
(Duppi v2.2.0+).

Those files can be installed by all versions of Duppi since v2.0.2 (that means
since Dragon UnPACKer v5.0.0 RC3!

DUPP v2 is compatible with all versions of Duppi (for Dragon UnPACKer stables)
but suffer from a CRC calculation mistake on included files.

DUPP v3 is compatible with all versions of Duppi since v2.2.0 and do not suffer
from the CRC mistake. The only difference between the two formats is the CRC
calculation. The formats in itself are structuraly identical.

  What's new?
  -----------

Version 2.0.0:

 i Too much to say. The program now works as it should, and I think I have
   found and fixed most bugs.
 + New Project files (.D5PP) to store new info.
   The format is just version 2 of the old format (.DPS) adding new XML nodes.
 ! I found a huge mistake in the CRC calculation done on files while compiling.
   The problem is by fixing it the D5P file is not working correctly with
   current version of Duppi because the mistake is there too...
   This means I had to add an option to be compatible with old buggy Duppy.
   The new correct implementation will produce D5P files that can only be used
   with Duppi v2.2.0 or earlier.
  

Version 1.0.0 Beta 1:

 + Added Load/Save project to .DPS (XML file / D5P Project).
 - Disabled custom banner (Duppi is unable to display them for the moment).
   This feature still needs to be worked out.
 i Program doesn't remember anything (recent save/load, window position, etc.).
