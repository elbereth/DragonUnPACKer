  What is DUPPI ?
  ---------------

This is the update manager for Dragon UnPACKer.
It has several features:
- Install update files (.D5P) to your Dragon UnPACKer folder
- Check for available updates on Internet (depending on your version)
- Download updates from Internet
Internet access can be direct or through a proxy.


  How to use DUPPI
  ----------------

Start the program without any parameter and you will get a wizard-like screen.
Just follow indications.

If you already downloaded an update file (.D5P) you can start the program with
that file in parameter:

Ex: DUPPI duppiupdate.d5p

Or just drag & drop the update file on duppi.exe.
This will start Duppi in installation mode and will present the install screen
for the package in parameter.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Duppi v3.4.0:
   i Updated to work with Indy 9 instead of Curl.
     This means a full Delphi implementation with no need for DLLs.
	 It is also compatible with Lazarus (Indy 9 & 10 were ported to Lazarus).
   i Now compiled with FastMM4, FastCode & FastMove.

 * Duppi v3.3.5:
   * Added new main icons for 64x64, 128x128 and 256x256.
     Based on Oxygen Team's Apps system software update icon.
	 Old resolutions 16x16 and 32x32 stays the same. :p
   i Updated libcurl to v7.21.6. 
 
 * Duppi v3.3.4:
   + Added Dragon UnPACKer build check on startup (FR #3089945).
   i Updated libcurl to v7.21.1. 

 * Duppi v3.3.3:
   ! Fixed the URL used when the user want to download manually a new version
     of Dragon UnPACKer.
	 
 * Duppi v3.3.2:
   ! Fixed version number of 3.3.1 (was still reporting 3.3.0). Sorry!
   
 * Duppi v3.3.1:
   ! Fixed the popup asking for update to newer version of Dragon UnPACKer even
     when no update package was available (ex: 5.2.0b --> 5.4.0a).

 * Duppi v3.3.0:
   + Added multi-server support (when one server fails to download an update
     Duppi will automatically try the next available one).
   + Added download verification by checking file size and hash.
   i Updated third party DLLs to libcurl v7.21.0 and zlib v1.2.5.
   
 * Duppi v3.2.1:
  ! Fixed banner bug showing beneath the text under Vista/7 when Aero was
    activated.
	
 * Duppi v3.2.0:
  + Added new DUPP v4 feature: Obsolete Files

 * Duppi v3.1.3:
  ! Fixed needed missing zlib1.dll.

 * Duppi v3.1.2:
  ! Fixed HUGE bug introduced in v3.1.0 that prevented Duppi from downloading
    any update from internet (fail with an Exception).
  ! Fixed bug introduced in v3.1.0 that prevented Duppi to update itself when
    libcurl-3.dll was in the package...

 * Duppi v3.1.1:
  ! Fixed small bug in information log

 * Duppi v3.1.0:
   * Optimized code to remove all useless units:
       JVCL & JCL are no more used
	   VirtualTree are no more used
	 This alone reduced size by 300kB...
   i Updated to work with curl instead of Overbyte's ICS.
     This was done in order to be more platform independant (FPC/Lazarus).
	 Tested successfully with v7.18.0 & 7.19.4. Will be packed with v7.18.0 in
	 order to reduce size (it is the latest version without SSL support).
   * Improved feedback to the user while installing DUPP v4 files.
   + Added log while installing to know what's going on.
   + Implemented auto-update of Dragon UnPACKer.
   ! Translated all text introduced with DUPP v4 support. Sorry to non-english
     speakers it was alwars showing in english...
	 This required bump in language version number (PI v2).
