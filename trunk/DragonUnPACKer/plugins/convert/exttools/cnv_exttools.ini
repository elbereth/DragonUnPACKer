; Path to the external tool (exe file)
; Can be relative to convert plugin folder of Dragon UnPACKer
; Or an absolute path
path=tools\vgmstream\test.exe

; Command line parameters:
;  %o is the output file (use "%o" to allow spaces in the filenames)
;  %i is the input file (use "%i" to allow spaces in the filenames)
command=-o "%o" "%i"

resultext=wav

; Result test (how to test it)
;  0 is =
;  1 is >
;  2 is <
;  3 is >=
;  4 is <=
;  5 is <>
; The test.exe program from vgmstream returns 0 if everything went fine
; That means we set resultoktest to 0 (equal)
; And resultok to 0. That means we test that result is 0.
; If the external tool returns anything else it will be considered an error
resultoktest=0
resultok=0

; What extensions can be converted using this tool (in-file extensions)
; Each extension must be separated by a space:

extensions=smp
